# What Is Momentum Trading?

Momentum trading is a technique in which traders buy and sell according to the strength of recent price trends. Price momentum is similar to momentum in physics, where mass multiplied by velocity determines the likelihood that an object will continue on its path. In financial markets, however, momentum is determined by other factors like trading volume and rate of price changes. Momentum traders bet that an asset price that is moving strongly in a given direction will continue to move in that direction until the trend loses strength.

## RELATIVE MOMENTUM AND ABSOLUTE MOMENTUM
Momentum trading can be classified in two categories: Relative momentum and absolute momentum.

* Relative momentum strategy is where the performance of different securities within a particular asset class are compared against one another, and investors will favour buying strong performing securities and selling weak performing securities.
* Absolute momentum strategy is where the behaviour of the price of a security is compared against its previous performance in a historical time series.

In currency trading, either relative or absolute momentum can be used. However, momentum trading strategies are more frequently associated with absolute momentum.

## HOW IS A MOMENTUM STRATEGY EMPLOYED?
Momentum can be determined over longer periods of weeks or months, or within day-trading time frames of minutes or hours.

The first step traders customarily take is to determine the direction of the trend in which they want to trade. Using one of several momentum indicators available, they may then seek to establish an entry point to buy (or sell) the asset they are trading. They will also want to determine a profitable and reasonable exit point for their trade based on projected and previously observed levels of support and resistance within the market.

## RISKS TO MOMENTUM TRADING
Like any style of trading, momentum trading is subject to risks. Itâ€™s been found to be successful when prices follow on a trend, but on occasion momentum traders can be caught off guard when trends go into unexpected reversals. Traders should remember that:

* Technical analysis bases its projections of the probability of price movements on past price trends.
* Prices in the market can move in an unforeseen manner at any time due to unexpected news events, or fears and changes in sentiment in the market.
